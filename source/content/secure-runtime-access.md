Pantheonâ€™s database services use strong random passwords and TLS to encrypt communications by default. Customers seeking additional defense in depth can enable Secure Runtime Access (SRA).

SRA actively discards attempts to connect to persistent instances like MySQL or SFTP, disregarding the attempt before it reaches the service. When SRA is enabled, the connection attempts to the service will be rejected unless the connection comes through the appropriate [SSH tunnel](/ssh-tunnels).

In addition to defense in depth, this feature can be used to enforce role-based permissions by preventing users with a developer role from accessing a live database. It also guarantees that users who are removed from a site team or organization can no longer use a saved set of credentials.

## How to Enable SRA on Your Site

Secure Runtime Access is available to [contract](https://pantheon.io/plans/pricing) customers with an [Organization](/organizations) dashboard. [Contact Sales](https://pantheon.io/contact-us) to request that SRA be enabled for your site.

### Considersations
Users with Secure Runtime Access need to have an active Dashboard session to access database services. The following considerations apply:

* Users cannot access MySQL or SFTP unless there is an active dashboard session. We determine which user should have access to mysql, sftp through the ssh key being used and which user account has the public key
* CI/CD integrations on sites that have SRA enabled and that rely on any of these services need to ensure they're creating a dashboard session.
* Dashboard sessions only last 24 hours
* You can start a new dashboard session by logging into `dashboard.pantheon.io` or running `terminus auth:login`.

## How to Access Runtime Services When SRA Is Enabled

Follow the [Secure Tunnels](/ssh-tunnels) doc to create the tunnel and access resources after SRA is enabled.

## What It Looks Like When a Connection Is Refused

When SRA is enabled and a connection is refused, SSH will respond with the `No route to host` error. To resolve this issue refer to the troubleshooting section of the [SSH Tunnels](/ssh-tunnels) doc.
