This section provides answers to frequently asked questions.

## When are Site Portfolio Reports sent?

You’ll receive Site Portfolio Reports through:

- Routine periodic invoicing (yearly or as per contract terms)

- Mid-year invoicing for existing sites with automatic upgrades

- Requests for invoicing submitted to Pantheon

## How do I know which changes relate to the invoice?

The Site Portfolio Report shows changes that appear in the invoice as charges for any site plan upgrades due to site traffic or new site additions.

The Site Portfolio Report can help you understand your invoice in two aspects:

- Change in Site Plan count

- Change in Site Plan Type

You might be under-utilizing the contract if the invoice exhibits more site plans than on the report. If there is a match between the site plan count and site plan type in invoice and on the report, Pantheon is charging you as expected.

## Can I schedule or request the Site Portfolio Report?

Yes. You can submit a request to Pantheon asking for your invoice and the supplemental Site Portfolio Report.

## Where do I go to see the amount I owe for each site? 

The total amount owed can be viewed on the invoice linked at the top of the Site Portfolio Report. The invoice only provides the overall total, and does not show how much is owed per site.

## How can I access the Site Portfolio Report?

Your Site Portfolio Report will be emailed to the Site Owner of the account. Click the link provided in the email to view the report.

## Who has access to the Site Portfolio Report?

The Site Portfolio Report is emailed to the Site Owner of the account. No other users will receive the email. However, the Site Owner can share the link provided in the email with other users.

## Can I share the Site Portfolio Report?

Yes. The Site Owner can share the link provided in the email with other users.

## Can I change who receives the Site Portfolio Report?

Yes. The Site Portfolio Report is emailed to the Site Owner on the account.  The current Site Owner must [transfer ownership directly](/site-billing#transfer-ownership-and-billing-for-this-site) if another teammate needs to assume site and billing ownership.

## Can my invoice be blank at any given time frame?

Blank invoices are not expected. However, your Site Portfolio Report can be blank. Blank Site Portfolio Reports are generated when your invoice is an exception. 

The Site Portfolio Report may not be generated or no data will be displayed on the report in the following cases:

- The invoice was generated within the first 30 days of contract / amendment live date

- A credit memo is issued or generated

- The invoice has no charges for site / site plans

- The invoice is not a positive invoice (i.e. it has a negative balance rather than a charge to the customer).

- You are a special-terms customer

## Will invoices be accessible all the time after they are generated or do they expire or archive after certain period of time?

The Site Portfolio Report does not expire during the active contract period. Any invoice pertaining to a new or renewed contract might result in a blank report or no report at all. Any invoice pertaining to a contract amendment might result in a report with no data for the amendment.

## Will credit memo related changes reflect on the report?

No. Credit memo related changes are not reflected on the Site Portfolio Report.

## Why do I see “Not determined” in the Site Owner column? 

Not determined means that the site owner was not specified in the workspace.

## What should I do if the link to the Site Portfolio Report is broken?

Contact your Pantheon account manager or [submit a support ticket](/guides/support/support-ticket/#organization-dashboard-support-tab) if the link to your Site Portfolio Report is broken.

## Who do I contact for support?
